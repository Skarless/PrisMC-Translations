# 
# > Do NOT change color codes. Color codes must be kept consistent between languages.
#   A color code can be seen in every messsage as an '&' symbol followed by a character.
#   For Example: "&b", "&2", "&l", "&f", and so on...  <<< DO NOT CHANGE THESE
#
# > When using a an apostrophe('), make sure to follow it by another.
#   For Example: "This isn''t a game, this is my life."
#
# > Variables are placed in certain messages to be swapped out for a player's username or other information.
#   These variables appear in brackets(ex: [PLAYER] [FRIEND] [MORTAL_ENEMY]), and will be auto-
#   filled by the server. DO NOT change the text within the brackets, otherwise the server will not-
#   know to replace the text.
